A Letter from the Colorado Workforce Development Council 
In Colorado, we believe in an ecosystem approach to solving our toughest challenges. We also believe that our talent development system must be business-led, and acutely attuned to the demand side of our state’s economy. The training and job placement programs are only beneficial when a career is waiting on the other side. Therefore this annual report on activities funded through WIOA is one component of the Colorado Talent Pipeline Report. Through these pages you will discover the depths of partnerships and the details of how public dollars are being put to use in communities all across the state, yielding a positive economic impact through higher incomes of workforce center customers and cost savings to employers who utilize services. 
The vision of our ecosystem, as detailed in our state plan, is that: all Colorado businesses have access to skilled talent, and all Coloradans have access to meaningful employment, resulting in statewide economic vitality. To achieve this vision, the public workforce system offers a variety of programs to meet individual needs and help every person and business discover ability, develop talent, and find success. Regardless of income, education level, or specialized skills, all career paths encounter moments when guidance and support is needed to achieve a desired goal. The public workforce system, through the locally-run programs at workforce centers and partner agencies, is here to be your guide. 
This report contains: 
. 
An update on the strategic section of Colorado’s state plan with a narrative summary of progress from all core programs; 

. 
A synopsis of results driven at the state level by Workforce Development Programs within the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment; and 

. 
Highlights from each of Colorado’s 10 local workforce areas, emphasizing the innovative practices being developed (in Appendix A). 


We are excited to share the successes of the past year and look forward to partnering with you in the years to come.

WIOA Strategic Plan Update 

Overview 
Colorado’s Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act state plan was approved by the federal government in fall 2016. A modified plan was submitted at the required two-year point and was approved in the summer of 2018. The following information is an update on the strategic work outlined within each of the five state goals listed below. The summaries include updates from each of the core WIOA programs: Adult, Youth, Dislocated Worker, Adult Education, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, and Wagner Peyser. The workforce system is actively working to streamline data and identify new ways to measure success together. In some cases, relevant or cross-agency data may not yet exist; you will find narrative updates in the place of numerical information. View the WIOA State Plan

Effectiveness in Serving Employers 
Colorado will be tracking all three of the metrics identified by US DOL during the baseline years of the effectiveness in serving employers performance measure. All states are required to officially select two measures to report on, and Colorado has selected: 
. Business Penetration Rate 
. Repeat Business Customers Colorado will also report on the third measure in order to provide abundant data to US DOL: 
. Retention of Employees with Same Business 
Employer Satisfaction Data 
Adult, Dislocated Worker, Youth, Wagner-Peyser --Workforce Development Programs, CDLE: 
CDLE implemented a new employer satisfaction survey in June 2016. From June 1st 2017 to September 30, 2018, percent employers who agree with the statement: “My engagement with the workforce center helped me find the right number of employees with the skills and experience I need.” 
Total PY17 Outcome: 93.6% of employers were satisfied or very satisfied 
Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, CDLE: 
DVR distributes a customer satisfaction survey to employers and business partners, in addition to others interacting with DVR staff. DVR is committed to continuing to make customer satisfaction surveys available to employers and increased the availability and methods of data collection. DVR leadership monitors survey responses and uses the information gathered to identify opportunities to improve the experience of businesses partnering with DVR. For program year 2017, DVR received a satisfaction rating of 71.4% from business partners. 
The Office of Adult Education Initiatives, CDE: 
Title II Adult Education programs did not collect employer satisfaction data in 2017-18 or prior years. The majority of allowable activities under Title II funds are customer-facing services rather than employer-facing services. With WIOA’s additional emphasis on employment outcomes and as the role of adult education programs within Colorado’s talent development system grows, direct contact with employers is increasing. The Office of Adult Education Initiatives (AEI) is working with adult education programs to collect feedback on a statewide standardized process for collecting employer satisfaction data. 
Sector Partnership Highlights 
Across Colorado, sector partnerships are engaging businesses, workforce, and economic development in industry-led priorities that will have a lasting impact on students, jobseekers, and the community. Sector partnerships in Colorado continue to identify key strategies for workforce development that are recognized nationally. In the last year, sector partnerships across the state have increased their involvement and initiatives to focus on work-based learning opportunities. This effort has increased the number of work-based learning activities in the continuum of learning about work, learning through work, and learning at work. 
Colorado has 26 sector partnerships in nine sectors, including health and wellness, manufacturing, retail, technology and information, tree care, tourism and outdoor recreation, construction, early childhood education, and value-added agriculture. In the last year, technology sector partnerships and an early childhood education sector partnership have launched. Colorado is also leading the way by launching the first Statewide Education Sector Partnership that will increase alignment across the education continuum. 
The 2018 Sectors Impact Survey showed that businesses involved in sector partnerships increased their participation by 10 percent in internships or apprenticeship programs in the last year. Ninety-eight percent of businesses also reported in the survey that they would recommend participating in a sector partnership to their peers. A participating business described a sector partnership as a “great opportunity to not only learn from other business partners but make viable connections to further enhance your business.”

Work-Based Learning Initiatives 
Colorado’s workforce development system has actively participated in and coordinated work-based learning initiatives alongside members of the broader talent development network. The WIOA core partners are moving forward work to serve both adult and opportunity youth job seekers. See below for a variety of programs and events that have focused on scaling up apprenticeships, internships, on-the-job training, competency based hiring, and other work-based learning initiatives. 
Business Experiential Learning (BEL) Commission: 
The BEL Commission is charged by executive order of the Governor to systematically expand work-based learning in Colorado. BEL works in collaboration with the Colorado Workforce Development Council (CWDC) and other state and local stakeholders. The CWDC’s ApprenticeshipUSA Accelerator Grant ($200,000) provided funding for the development and initial implementation of a strategic plan, and implementation roadmap for the BEL Commission. Through this planning process the state created the Work-based Learning Unit at CDLE for expansion of all work-based learning efforts with a specific focus on expanding registered apprenticeships. This unit works with local workforce centers and industry partners to expand opportunity youth and adult programs and partners with CareerWise Colorado to create a youth apprenticeship system for Colorado. 
Since 2015, the BEL Commission has been a leader in developing systematic solutions for integrating work-based education and training that meets the needs of Colorado’s economy. Additionally, during 2017-2018, BEL worked with business leaders and state agencies to identify several priorities to advance a work-based learning system in Colorado. These five priorities are listed below in addition to key accomplishments of BEL and key statewide partners: 
1. 
Providing guidance and input to support the development of high-quality work-based learning initiatives 

2. 
Shifting public perception and awareness of work-based learning opportunities 

3. 
Working with businesses to identify opportunities to promote skill-based hiring and work-based learning as a strategy to address talent shortages 

4. 
Engaging the education and training providers to support them in teaching what people need to know to succeed in Colorado’s economy 

5. 
Supporting the promotion of a policy environment to advance and promote the work of the BEL Commission 


ApprenticeshipUSA State Expansion Grant: 
In November 2016, CDLE received the ApprenticeshipUSA State Expansion grant. This $1.8 million grant initially ran from November 2016 to April 2018. In May of 2018, CDLE successfully secured an additional $1 million continuation grant to continue the work through Oct. 31, 2020. Together these two funding sources are supporting work to increase the number and diversity of Registered Apprenticeship programs in Colorado as well as align them with the state’s employment, education and economic development systems. These grants are also increasing the level of support for individual apprentices within the programs. Although the grant period has been extended by USDOL through Oct. 31, 2020, CDLE has already exceeded all grant goals for program development and demographic inclusion. 
To expand apprenticeship opportunities for opportunity youth and adults, workforce staff and partners pursued recruitment of businesses and industry intermediaries to participate in building both the local sector partnerships and the statewide network of apprenticeships. Similarly, grant partner CareerWise expanded its efforts to embed pre-apprenticeships and apprenticeships in secondary schools across the state. As of July 31, 2018, 33 new sponsors had registered their apprenticeship programs in the state. These new sponsors as well as existing sponsors added 56 new apprenticeships in diverse occupations throughout the state. In addition, CDLE and workforce center staff engaged in apprenticeship conversations with over 200 businesses. This work is fundamentally changing the way Colorado’s workforce and educational systems approach employment and training for youth and adults. 
The focus on diversification of populations engaged in apprenticeship programs is yielding positive results. Statistically in Colorado, 93% of apprentices have been male and 67% Caucasian. In order to support diversification across the state, the department released funding in April to local workforce areas to support underrepresented populations. The impact of the resulting work can be seen through recent statistics indicating that of the 268 apprentices that the workforce system has supported since the inception of the grant, 32% of them are female and 49% are underrepresented ethnicities. 
Impact Stories 
Kevin was released from the Colorado Department of Corrections in October 2016. He became enrolled in the Road to Work program on November 3, 2016 and began the first year of his Electrician Apprenticeship at IEC on November 7, 2016. The first year was funded by Road to Work as he did not have an income after being incarcerated for quite some time. He successfully completed his first year on March 20, 2017 with an A. Kevin was hired by Foster Electric Group on April 5, 2017 as a full time electrician’s assistant. He is now in his second year of his apprenticeship and the school reports that he is maintaining a high A average. 
Mr. D was a recently separated, unemployed veteran who was living in his vehicle and whose service-connected disability prevented him from working in his previous occupation. Workforce Specialists helped him identify housing resources while developing work strengths, defining transferable skills, and setting employment goals. Mr. D was interested in the Lockheed Martin AMTAP program, a 9-week apprenticeship that leads to full time employment opportunities. He was selected for the AMTAP apprenticeship, successfully completed the program at the top of his class, and is now both housed and working full time at Lockheed Martin. 
Colorado Works Subsidized Training and Employment Program (CW STEP): 
In May of 2017, the Colorado legislature passed Senate Bill 17-292 authorizing the Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS) to create a subsidized employment program for recipients of Colorado Works basic cash assistance. Colorado Works is the state’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. For implementation of this $4,000,000 grant, CDHS entered into partnership with the CDLE, calling on the agency’s expertise in grant coordination, monitoring, and technical assistance. Through this partnership, Colorado is setting an example of how two state agencies can work collaboratively towards a common goal for one of the cohorts of job seekers we share. CW STEP began on January 1, 2018, and is operating across the state in twelve counties through four local area contractors. It will end its first cycle on June 30, 2019, and its final cycle on June 30, 2020. The goal of the first cycle of the grant is to have 445 individuals participate in one of these work experiences, and for 156 of the participants to obtain unsubsidized employment. As of the end of the PY17 Program Year, the grant is exceeding its placement goal and meeting its employment goal.

Impact Stories 
When Alycia started the CW STEP program, she was underemployed, working part time at 7-11, making just a bit over minimum wage. She liked the work, and was well respected by her supervisors and co-workers, but she knew that this type of employment would not support her and her three children. She enjoyed the customer service work, so she was interested in increasing her computer skills to begin a career in a professional office. She was placed in an internship with Jefferson County’s Child Care Assistance Program business office learning data entry, Excel, filing, and Outlook, as well as focusing on her professionalism. The CW STEP team continued their support of Alycia, helping her create a targeted resume, conducting mock interviews, and assisting to focus her job search. The result of this team effort was an offer of employment from Wells Fargo, earning $15/hour working in their customer service department. 
Carla is a single mother who has encountered many “potholes” on her road to success. She and her children were homeless due to domestic violence; she did not have a driver’s license or her GED; she had involvement with the criminal justice system; and she had a lack of work experience after being a stay-at-home mother for so many years. After focusing on her education goals—and passing her GED within a month—Carla was ready to tackle employment with CW STEP. After building a strong relationship through volunteering, Carla began an internship with the Weld Food Bank in March of 2018. Her CW STEP worker helped her rewrite her resume, and her current supervisor gave her a strong letter of recommendation. Armed with this, and her newly found confidence, Carla secured employment in June 2018 with StarTek in Greeley, CO. 
Innovative Industries Internship (III) Program – House Bill 15-1230: 
CDLE received a state general fund grant to launch the Innovative Industries Internship program on January 1, 2016. The program provides funding for up to 90 internships annually and is designed to incentivize businesses in innovative industries to build a talent pipeline and career pathways to align education, training, and work-based learning. The program model provides half of internship costs with a cap of $5,000 per internship. The state provides incentives directly to businesses and links employers and interns to the local workforce areas for ongoing support when applicable. The program was developed using Agile and Lean strategies and provides web-based applications, internship resources, program orientation, evaluations, and billing. Employers work directly with the state program coordinator and receive individual support when necessary. The state also contracts with six industry associations to assist with program development and employer outreach. 
The program has been tremendously popular with Colorado employers. Program outcomes from inception through June 30, 2018 are as follows: 
. 
424 internships have been approved throughout Colorado since program launch. 

. 
279 businesses within the eight innovative industries have been approved since program inception, of which 7% are rural and 93% are within the Metro Denver area. 

. 
Participating interns were making a minimum of $10.20/hr and up to $27.00/hr. Average hourly wage is $15.06. 

. 
Demand from employers for additional interns continues to exceed current program funding. 


Impact Story 
Business and intern feedback is important as it provides critical insight and opportunity to enhance the program. One business states, "This is a great opportunity to grow the skilled workforce we need in the Front Range. What a great opportunity to encourage a small company…to be able to offer an intern opportunity like this. The intern comes away with real experience that can benefit his future employer (if not us) when he graduates.” Another business states, “This program allowed us to hire an intern and address long term infrastructure projects that we would not otherwise have the bandwidth to complete.” 
Governor’s Summer Job Hunt (GSJH): 
The GSJH is a Wagner-Peyser section 7(b) funded statewide program that assists Colorado’s youth, ages 14-24, with career exploration, workforce readiness, and interest-based job search. During the 2017 calendar year, 41,589 youth and young adults registered for the program statewide, with a 60% entered employment rate. Local areas continue to market their services aggressively to in-school youth via school districts, and to all youth through local partner organizations. 
. 
Over 21,000 youth received direct services and these youth received over 77,000 referrals to other programs and services in local communities. 

. 
Statewide, over 10,000 youth participated directly in local job fairs, career events, and workshops. 

. 
Governor Hickenlooper filmed a public service announcement, combined with statewide and regional press releases by CDLE for the program in 2017. 


Local Impacts 
Weld County: Employment Services of Weld County (ESWC) strived toward increased dedication to rural youth in the South Weld County region. ESWC accomplished this goal by partnering with Fort Lupton High School, Weld Central High School, Aims Community College and local employers to expose more youth to post-secondary education opportunities and work experience. 
One big success for ESWC was the collaborative effort from all programs to solidify the program known as Weld Works 4 Youth. This summer employment program came back to life after a seven-year hiatus due to lack of funding. The program was able to employ a total of 47 young adults ages 14-17 and provide life skills workshops throughout the summer. The reintroduction of the program was a success that they hope to continue for years to come. 
Larimer County: Community Summer Internship (CSI) program: During the spring of 2017, Larimer created a summer work experience program for low-income youth, ages 16-18. CSI work experiences provided employment skill development, opportunities to explore careers, networking connections with adult business professionals, and added summer income to young adults. Internships were designed for 25 hours/week for 10 weeks with wages subsidized at $10 per hour. Twelve local businesses participated by hosting and training interns. 
Youth Entrepreneur Tournament: 34 of 35 youth completed the YET experience in 2017 to develop and pitch a business plan, and $1,900 in business investment awards were distributed to six youth businesses developed from YET. In 2017 YET also grew the number of participants served by 40% from the previous year. 
Virtual Job Shadow: 
During PY17 WDP continued promotion of the Virtual Job Shadow, an interactive career exploration tool. VirtualJobShadow.com is a highly engaging, fully digital career exploration and workforce development resource for post-secondary students, opportunity youth, adult and dislocated workers. It brings job shadowing directly to the user, eliminating many of the costs and challenges frequently associated with traditional job shadowing. During PY17, WDP continued to engage with local area workforce centers and partners to provide demonstrations that highlight careers in the “world of work” from the VJS platform. 
WBL Learning Labs: 
The TalentFOUND Sector Summit on Work-based Learning was hosted in October 2017 and convened leaders across Colorado to identify opportunities to advance work-based learning. During the Summit, the Colorado Workforce Development Council introduced the Thriving Work-based Learning Model. The model provides a framework to support cross-sector community collaboration to develop strong work-based learning opportunities as a strategy for strengthening regional economies. Following the Summit, the CWDC released $450,000 in flexible grant funds to increase capacity in communities to collaborate across business, education and workforce and support the implementation of the model. In addition to funding, grantees are engaging in a 12 month WBL Learning Lab to explore challenges faced across initiatives and engage in peer-problem solving to strengthen collaboration and high quality work-based learning policies and practices. 
Rapid Response/Layoff Assistance Services 
While Colorado continues to enjoy unemployment rates lower than the national average and a growing economy, businesses continue to conduct layoffs and utilize Rapid Response services. In PY17, a total of 78 companies reported layoffs affecting 7,730 employees. The industries most impacted by layoffs were Retail Trade (affecting 2,858 employees), Manufacturing (755), and Health Care/Social Assistance (677). The local areas most impacted were Pikes Peak (19), Arapahoe/Douglas (15), Denver (10), Larimer (8) and Adams (7). All companies were offered Rapid Response services. A total of 57 Rapid Response events were delivered with 1,163 attending. Customer satisfaction among job seekers and employers remained high, achieving a 99% satisfaction rating in both categories. 
Impact Story 
Amid an increasing demand for addiction treatment services due to the opioid crisis, Arapahoe House, one of Colorado’s oldest and most prominent addiction treatment providers, announced on December 15th that it would be closing its facilities due to a lack of funding. Arapahoe House treated between 4,000 and 5,000 patients annually, operating four residential treatment programs and outpatient facilities located in Aurora, Denver, Lakewood and Thornton. As a result of the closures, Arapahoe House announced that 204 employees would be separated on January 2, 2018. 
The Rapid Response Coordinator quickly reached out to the CEO of Arapahoe House to determine if they had identified other treatment facilities that could take on patients and potentially hire Arapahoe House staff. Potential buyers of the treatment facilities, as well as additional detox facilities handling 14,000 admissions each year, were discussed with the CEO. The three Arapahoe House detox centers were later purchased by some of the partners identified as potential buyers including the Jefferson Center for Mental Health, Aurora Mental Health, and Community Reach. The companies making these purchases retained the Arapahoe House personnel, and, as a result, those layoffs were averted. The Arapahoe House treatment center in Thornton was purchased by Community Reach. The women’s residential treatment facility in Westminster was purchased by Mile High Behavioral Health. The detox center located in Littleton was purchased by Parker Valley Hope and is scheduled to open in January 2019. Some employees at the treatment facilities were retained, but an exact count is currently unknown. 
After receiving the WARN notification of the layoffs, the Rapid Response team quickly mobilized resources from several local workforce areas, the CDLE Unemployment Insurance Division, Connect for Health Colorado and CUSO Financial to deliver a series of three on-site workshops on December 28 and 29. A total of 79 people attended. Attendees at Rapid Response workshops received current job leads, relevant professional certification information, healthcare and financial/401K guidance and resources. As a result, a number of employees who were not offered jobs after the sale of the facilities were able to find work elsewhere before their layoff dates. 
Layoff Aversion: 
Colorado continues to shift the paradigm from a reactive to a proactive approach to layoffs. Building on the success of last year’s Saving Colorado Jobs Layoff Aversion conference and the subsequent layoff aversion planning sessions, during this year the Rapid Response team sponsored trips for Rapid Response Coordinators to attend the United States Department of Labor Region 4 Showcase in Dallas and the National Rapid Response Summit in Boston to learn about best practices in business engagement and layoff aversion from other states. Colorado’s Rapid Response Coordinator presented “Leveraging Industry Sectors for Business Engagement & Layoff Aversion” at the Rapid Response Summit national conference and provided subject matter expertise while facilitating a sectors roundtable. 
For the second year, the PY18 local area planning questions included the requirement for local areas to develop and communicate a layoff aversion strategy. 
Building on the previous year’s webinar series that presented “Layoff Aversion, Your Local Plan and You,” additional webinars were launched including “Workshare 101” and “Leveraging Rapid Response to Increase Dislocated Worker Program Enrollments.” The Rapid Response team also evaluated several data analytics programs that could support layoff aversion and business engagement activities. The evaluation is still in progress pending agreement by a significant number of organizations to pay a portion of the cost. If purchased, a data analytics program would allow predictive insights into potential layoffs as much as six months to one year in advance. The data and tools available would also significantly improve business engagement across the state. 
National Dislocated Worker Grants Sector Partnerships National Dislocated Worker Grant: 
In PY15, CDLE was awarded the Sector Partnerships National Dislocated Worker Grant (NDWG). This $5 million grant was extended in March of 2017 and ended in June 2018. The grant provided support to participating local areas to establish and maintain a Sector Partnership in one or more targeted industry sector(s), utilizing the partnership to identify existing and emerging workforce needs, and offer work-based-training opportunities to prepare Coloradans for work within in-demand, middle-skill, and middle-wage occupations. Concurrently, this grant provided work-based training and support funding to prepare 500 dislocated Colorado workers, who have been identified as unlikely to return to their previous occupations, to fill the jobs identified by the Sector Partnership as in-demand. 
Throughout the life of the grant, the Sector Partnerships NDWG served a total of 699 Dislocated Workers across the State of Colorado. 
Impact Story 
In December 2018, Terry S. was co-enrolled into the Dislocated Worker and NDWG programs to support an On-the-Job (OJT) with Huerfano County for Chief Building Inspector. Terry had attended college for Civil Engineering but did not have a degree. He had worked extensively in the construction industry and was laid off from the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station in South Carolina, which closed in 2017 due to cost overages. Terry initially expressed an interest in the condensed Electric Lineman program at Trinidad State Jr. College, but then this building inspector position opened. An OJT introduction letter was attached to his application and he landed the job. Huerfano County was reimbursed $5,000 for Terry’s training. He was off and running. His evaluations were glowing and he concluded his plan successfully in March 2018. He stops in to see his case manager a few times a month to update her on his employment, and he is very grateful for our assistance. In his position, he has been instrumental in the Spring Fire Recovery process.

Customer Satisfaction 
During PY17 local areas in Colorado conducted independent job seeker customer satisfaction surveys through the use of locally determined survey questions and methodologies. In addition, CDLE issued a policy guidance letter in the summer of 2016 requiring the implementation of the electronic survey in all one-stop centers by no later than September 30, 2016. These surveys are offered to all customers receiving staff–assisted services. 
Through the Statewide Business Services Alignment initiative, local business services staff identified 11 core staff-assisted business services available to all business customers. Businesses receiving any of the core services are automatically emailed a customer satisfaction survey. The standardized questions asked on each survey result in metrics that provide staff with valuable information that can be utilized to address issues with their service provision, and create an open feedback loop that supports continuous improvement. A report of outcomes is available on demand, and works in conjunction with a business services report that shows the volume of activities happening with businesses and highlights the placement rate achieved by businesses in workforce-center supported efforts. 
Adult, Dislocated Worker, Youth, Wagner-Peyser --Workforce Development Programs, CDLE: 
CDLE implemented a new version of the customer satisfaction survey in October 2017. From October 1st, 2017 through July 31st, 2018, percent job seekers and students who agree with the statement: “My engagement with the workforce center helped me access the resources and/or training I need to find a job or advance in my career.” 
PY17 Outcomes: Somewhat Agree 22.02% Strongly Agree 49.46% Neutral 17.09% Strongly Disagree 5.05% Somewhat Disagree 6.38% 
Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, CDLE: 
DVR makes a customer satisfaction survey available to all customers, as well as employers, vendors, and other stakeholders interacting with DVR staff. DVR received a total of 325 survey responses between July 2017 and June 2018. DVR is committed to continuing to make customer satisfaction surveys available to customers and continue to increase the number of customers providing this feedback. DVR leadership monitors survey responses and use the information gathered to identify opportunities to improve the experience of all customers. Satisfaction results are also considered by the department director. 
Results over this period of time demonstrate that 76% of DVR clients feel DVR staff consistently act in a courteous and professional manner; 70% report DVR staff have the knowledge to answer their questions; 68% indicate DVR staff provide assistance and are helpful in resolving problems; and 66% feel services and supports are delivered in a timely fashion. While these responses reflect a modest improvement over the prior year, DVR continues to monitor survey results and seek opportunities to improve the customer experience through staff training and process improvement efforts. 
The Office of Adult Education Initiatives, CDE: 
Title II Adult Education programs did not collect learner satisfaction data in a standardized way in 2017-18 nor in prior years. Some programs reported delivering periodic paper surveys with learners to better understand how programming could better meet their needs while others reported conducting exit interviews with learners to identify strengths and weaknesses in the support provided to learners to reach their goals. The Office of Adult Education Initiatives is working with Adult Education programs to collect feedback on a statewide standardized process for collecting learner satisfaction data. 
Job Seeker Services Alignment Team Update 
During PY17 the Job Seeker Services Alignment Team refined its focus and consolidated work groups. The activities of the Triage and Matrix Team were concluded, and the Model Forms Team was rolled into the Systems Integration Team. The resulting structure focuses on cross-education, accessibility, and system integration. An Annual Report will be released in February 2019 that will include more detailed performance and outcome information on these work groups.

The Business Services Partnership Engagement Work Group’s mission is to collaborate with WIOA partners to develop strategies that align business services. In addition to WIOA Workforce Center staff, staff representing Veterans Services and the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation have been engaged in this work. 
The team has created a “one-stop” business services partner desk aid. Each local area has their own tab that is updated about every six months. This is linked in Connecting Colorado for easy access. This gives local areas contact information for our mandatory partners. 
The team will next be working with our WIOA partners to identify the following: 
. 
Identify which partners engage and serve businesses in Colorado (this will be kept updated in the desk aid mentioned above) 

. 
Identify how partners record and collect any/all information on businesses 

. 
Identify what services partners provide (this will be added to the desk aid) 

. 
Identify alignment between partners 

. 
Connect MIS teams between WF and mandatory partners to figure out how to pull necessary data 

. 
Identify how to make data align when using different databases 


Career Pathways 
Colorado recognizes the importance of creating career pathways that empower individuals with the credentials, skills, and competencies Coloradans need to succeed in the labor market. The development of Colorado career pathways for other sectors started with support of HB 15-1274, which since 2015 has produced statewide and regionalized occupation pathways for all individuals throughout Colorado in: 
. 
Information Technology 

. 
Business Operations 

. 
Healthcare 

. 
Cybersecurity 

. 
Construction 


. Advanced Manufacturing These career pathways help individuals navigate top demand careers that will lead to long-term individual prosperity while fulfilling the economic demands of the shifting economy. During PY17, the focus industries were Business Operations and Cybersecurity. 
Through employer forums held across the state, industry leaders validated pathway data compiled by the project team that led to the publication of these two industries on 
careersincolorado.org. 
Holistic Services Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Program (MSFW): 
The MSFW program is a Wagner-Peyser section 7(b) funded program. Colorado is designated as a significant MSFW state, and administers a bilingual (English/Spanish) outreach program through workforce centers to ensure that equitable services are provided to all MSFW clientele. Services include job referrals, staff assisted services, referral to supportive services, career guidance, job development, job placement, placement in jobs paying $0.50 above minimum wage, and placement in non-agricultural jobs for over 150 days. During PY16, Colorado met all of its compliance indicators. Of the 1,600 MSFWs registered for services in PY17: 
. 
61.9% were referred to a job 

. 
89.9% received a staff assisted service 

. 
69.75% obtained employment 

. 
65% obtained employment 50 cents above minimum wage 

. 
29.4% were referred to career guidance 

. 
53.72% were referred to supportive services 


MSFW coalitions of workforce and partner agencies sponsor yearly migrant appreciation events throughout the state. In PY17 staff held two events, one in Greeley and one in Manzanola. The Greeley area event was attended by approximately 400 MSFWs. During this event, nineteen different agencies provided information on services and educational materials to all who attended. The event in Manzanola was canceled because the harvest ended early and most MSFWs had already returned home. Next program year the event will be held as a welcome in mid-to-late July instead of mid-September. 
Statewide Impact 
Colorado has a history of collaboration with agencies that serve the MSFW population. During PY17, the Colorado Department of Labor, Migrant Education, Migrant Health, USDA Rural Development, Rocky Mountain SER, Equal Employment Opportunity, Mexican Consulate, Harvest America, Chamber of the Americas and other agencies initiated planning to co-sponsor a Colorado Regional Farmworker Summit to be held in December of 2018. In PY16 the first Colorado Regional Farmworker Summit was very successful. The feedback we received indicated that a second summit should be planned. The second Summit’s objective is to concentrate on labor and housing issues in Colorado. 
Colorado continues its collaboration by being active in the MSFW coalitions around the state. Colorado’s State Monitor Advocate is the Chair of the state level coalition and is an active member in the Delta, La Junta, Pueblo and Greeley coalitions as well as being active in the Human Trafficking Coalition. 
Goal 3 
Engage partner staff at every level for better system alignment 
Strategies: 
. 
Implement continuous professional development for staff from all partner programs to elevate internal expertise and professionalism and to equip them with the tools necessary to operate a comprehensive, holistic approach to talent development. 

. 
Create opportunities for staff at all levels to engage in continuous improvement 


efforts, leveraging their first-hand experience and unique perspectives to inform the processes. 
Current Measures: 
. Cross-Education Team Update 
Job Seeker Services’ Cross Education Team 
The Cross Education Team develops training opportunities for collaboration and education across WIOA programs. Considering the success of the Spring 2016 statewide training and that frontline staff may need refresher content or are new to their roles, the focus of the Cross Education Team shifted to developing asynchronous, on-demand online modules in Moodle outlining the basics of each WIOA program (and partner programs outlined in the WIOA Colorado State Plan). 
As part of these online modules, the Cross Education Team is planning to develop a Colorado Talent Development Professional Certification. The team is working to identify the best process to create a professional certification recognized across all WIOA programs. During PY16 and the first half of PY17, a variety of training models have been delivered to staff throughout the state. This strategy will be a focus for PY18. 
Due to staff transitions and the lengthy contracting process, the team was not able to begin developing online courses in 2018. A Moodle pilot group has been created and is going through training on how to use the Moodle learning management system. Course development will begin in Q1 of 2019. 
Goal 4 
Create and deliver a unified message for internal and external communication 
Strategies: 
. 
Establish a brand for the Colorado workforce development system that represents the vision and strategies of the WIOA combined partners. 

. 
Define the key messages and brand promise for target audiences. 

. 
Explore ways to capture the Return on Investment (ROI) of the workforce system in order to promote the value of the system and all programs within it. 


Current Measures: 
. 
TalentFOUND narrative update 

. 
TalentFOUND number of charter affiliates 


TalentFOUND Update 
The Colorado Workforce Development Council has been working with talent development network partners to create a centralized brand and communications plan to better connect with those we serve. Our aim is to “create and deliver a unified message for internal and external communication and connections” as set forth by Colorado’s WIOA implementation plan (Goal 4), the Governor’s Workforce and Education Cabinet Work Group, and the CWDC’s strategic plan. 
TalentFOUND has three main components: the TalentFOUND network of partners, of which we currently have 120 official affiliates from across all systems of the network; the TalentFOUND umbrella brand which has been used for a number of collaborative projects across the network; and the TalentFOUND electronic gateway, which more efficiently connects students, job seekers, and employers with the tools and resources of the talent development network. 
TalentFOUND.org went live in June 2018 and a public push to drive students, job seekers, and employers to the gateway began in fall 2018. TalentFOUND.org is the hub through which students, job seekers, workers, and businesses can search, filter, and access the many resources and tools available throughout the entire talent development network in Colorado. In turn these resources will help each individual design his or her own unique path to success. We are gathering metrics on site usage and user experience to determine how we can continue to improve moving forward. 
Goal 5 
Drive meaningful outcomes through innovation, alignment of metrics, and accountability 
Strategies: 
. 
Adopt system-wide outcome metrics to portray an accurate depiction of the workforce system, which will be used for planning and implementation of system services. 

. 
Utilize partner relationships to implement meaningful pilot programs that foster an environment of innovation.

Cost Effective Analysis 


Measurable Skill Gains 
Adult, Dislocated Worker, Youth, Wagner-Peyser --Workforce Development Programs, CDLE: 
Measurable Skill Gains is the percentage of Job Seekers who, during a program year, are in an education or training program that leads to a recognized postsecondary credential or employment and who are achieving measurable skill gains toward such a credential or employment. 
2017-18 Program Year Measurable Skill Gains . Adult: 55.95% 
. Dislocated Worker: 53.96% . Youth: 55.66% 
Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, CDLE: 
DVR has implemented changes to the data management system used by the agency to ensure timely and accurate reporting of all required federal reporting, including common performance measures. Additionally, business practices have been developed and continue to be refined to ensure accurate documentation of measurable skill gains. For the 2017-18 program year, the measurable skill gains were achieved for 13.65% of DVR participants receiving training services. 
The Office of Adult Education Initiatives, CDE: 
For the 2017-18 program year, Title II Adult Education programs had a Measurable Skill Gain (MSG) rate of 30.47% for all program participants. This was the only federally negotiated target for Title II programs as USDOE is collecting baseline data on the remainder of the WIOA common measures for use in future target negotiations. MSG in Title II can be measured in one of three ways: 
. 
Making a pre-and post-test gain, equivalent to advancing two grade levels, on standardized and approved assessments 

. 
Earning a High School Equivalency Diploma through one of three assessments (GED, HiSET, TASC) 

. 
Exiting Title II programming and entering post-secondary education or training 


Pre-and post-test gains are collected based on test scores submitted to the Office of Adult Education Initiatives (AEI) at CDE through a statewide data reporting system. High School Equivalency Diploma attainment is collected through a data match with the provider issuing equivalency diplomas in Colorado. Post-secondary matriculation data is collected through a data match with the Colorado Department of Higher Education. Data matching relies on Social Security Number (SSN) reporting which is not required for participation in Title II programs; approximately 50% of adult learners reported an SSN in 2017-18. Additionally, the current postsecondary matriculation match only includes two and four year institutions in Colorado, which excludes many short-term workforce training programs which adult education learners participate in. 
AEI is working with Title II programs to increase the MSG rate, focusing on strategies that address data match criteria collection and instructional supports to increase persistence, retention, and outcomes for target populations with low MSG rates. 
Median Earnings After Services 
Adult, Dislocated Worker, Youth, Wagner-Peyser --Workforce Development Programs, CDLE: 
The median earnings performance measure is for adult and dislocated worker job seekers who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit. This is the earnings for which 50 percent of participant earnings are higher than and 50 percent of the participant earnings are lower than. 
WIOA Adult PY17 target: Median Earnings in the 2nd quarter after exit $7,388 
Actual: $6,767 WIOA Dislocated Worker PY17 target: Median Earnings in the 2nd quarter after exit $8,440 
Actual: $9,971 Wagner-Peyser PY17 target: Median Earnings in the 2nd quarter after exit $4,871 
Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, CDLE: 
DVR has implemented changes to the data management system used by the agency to ensure timely and accurate reporting of all required federal reporting, including common performance measures. Additionally, DVR has implemented and continues to refine business practices to ensure accurate collection and documentation of median earnings of program participants after their exit from DVR. Listed below are the median earnings for DVR by quarter: 
. 
Closed first quarter 2017 -$3350.17 

. 
Closed second quarter 2017 -$3349.95 

. 
Closed third quarter 2017 -$3695.79 


The Office of Adult Education Initiatives, CDE: 
For the 2016-17 program year, Title II Adult Education participants had $134,536 in Median Earnings. This data is collected through a data match with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment. 
Innovative Pilots 
The Colorado WIOA Implementation Team is working to encourage and support the identification and scaling up of successful local pilots happening across the state. The hope is to encourage innovation and collaboration across WIOA partners both locally and statewide. Please see Appendix A to find examples of local pilots and innovations that have occurred in local areas. 
State Evaluation Activities 
In accordance with Colorado’s philosophy of local control, each local area designs and conducts its own evaluation. Additionally, CDLE has evaluated each local area’s outcomes by utilizing WIOA indicators of performance for adults, dislocated workers, and youth programs, as outlined in TEGL 10-16. Tools are provided allowing each local area to track its performance on these measures as the year progresses and to let them track the impact on performance of each of their clients. Colorado did not conduct any formal statewide evaluations during PY17, but has laid the groundwork for incorporating formal evaluation into each new grant that is received. 
To promote and accelerate the evaluation process and activities, CDLE/Workforce Development Programs provided field staff training, technical assistance and additional resources. Concurrently CDLE awarded $200,000 in grant funding ($20,000 per local workforce area) to all local workforce development boards to develop a formal evaluation plan prior to undertaking evaluation activities. Two local workforce areas are the furthest along by working with long-time evaluation contractor Mathematica, getting constructive feedback through their evaluation work. 
In addition, Colorado’s approach is to use both quantitative and qualitative data and a human-centered design lens to determine the overall effectiveness of a service or process, identify potential promising programs, and suggest new strategies to help improve the overall workforce system. Moving forward, Colorado believes a multi-state collaborative approach to evaluation will allow us to draw on a larger pool of evaluation talent, and build a supportive community of practice. We have been in discussions with the National Governors Association (NGA) and other State Liaisons and a third-party entity to build out our expertise using leveraged resources, from a multi-state collaboration, to create a more robust evaluation process and system. 
CDLE’s comprehensive monitoring guide, recognized as a model by the US Department of Labor (USDOL), is the end result of an on-going monitoring and technical assistance process that has built a strong working relationship between the state and the local workforce areas. Quarterly, state monitors from CDLE meet with the local areas they oversee to review client service levels, program expenditure rates, and performance outcome results. Through these reviews, staff identifies areas which may require additional technical assistance and training to rectify any deficiencies prior to the start of the annual state compliance monitoring. 
Cost Effective Analysis 
Colorado works to ensure that all its resources are expended in the most effective and cost efficient way possible. We have a continuing policy of examining the outcomes and cost effectiveness of all of our programs in order to guide us in this effort. In this analysis we consider both benefits for our clients and cost savings/increased revenue for government entities. In many cases, there will be a reduction in governmental costs due to elimination or reduction of dependence on TANF, food stamps, unemployment insurance benefits, and other forms of public assistance. Studying the increases in taxes paid and decrease in reliance on public assistance would require coordination with several other agencies with privacy rules that make this sort of study extremely difficult, if not impossible at this time. Colorado has been working with partners to implement a data warehouse that will enable a return on investment approach to our programs. In addition, we have initiated a partnership with the Colorado Department of Human Services to develop data sharing protocols that will support future evaluation efforts. Currently we can only look at average cost per participant as a guide to this combined with our results on the performance measures. 
Adult Program 
. Expenditures -$7,268,095 
. Cost per client served -$2,279 (served 3,189) 
Youth Program 
. Expenditures -$7,639,064 
. Cost per client served -$2,822 (served 2,707) 
Dislocated Worker Program 
. Expenditures -$7,500,999 
. Cost per client served -$5,216 (served 1,438) 
Common Exit Policy 
CDLE’s Workforce Development Programs has published Policy Guidance Letter (PGL) MIS­2017-01, which contains the state’s common exit policy, applicable to the WIOA Title I, Wagner-Peyser, and TAA programs. The following is an excerpt from this PGL: 
Exits: An Exiter is a Participant who has not received a participation service for 90 consecutive calendar days, has no gap in service, and is not scheduled for future services. 
a. 
Exit Defined: (see 20 CFR 677.150 for full definition) – Exit is the point after which a participant who has received services through any program meets the following criteria: 

i. For the adult, dislocated worker, youth and TAA programs, and the Wagner-Peyser program (PT program code), the exit date is the last date of a participation service. 
ii. The last day of a participation service cannot be determined until at least 90 days have elapsed since the participant last received services; participation services do not include supportive services (except for youth), self-service, administrative, information-only services, follow-up services, or locally defined services. This also requires that there are no plans to provide the participant with future services. 

b. 
Co-enrolled Exiters: A co-enrolled participant cannot be exited until participation has been completed for all of the programs in which the participant is enrolled. This is consistent with USDOL’s requirement that—at a minimum—there be a common exit date across WIOA Title I, TAA and Wagner-Peyser (PT). There is one exception to this rule, as follows: 


i. Discretionary Grants -Exit in a discretionary grant program must occur when participation in that grant has been completed or the grant expires. For National Dislocated Worker Grants, participants must be exited no later than the date the grant expires, but exits prior to the expiration date must follow the 90-day rule. 
NOTE: If an individual is co-enrolled in the WIOA youth program and any other program, and is receiving supportive services, this service will be considered a participation service and will extend participation. NOTE: A planned gap in service can only be entered by an MIS representative. Staff should contact their local MIS representative for assistance in storing a Gap in Service.

Local Workforce Area Highlights 
Adams County Workforce & Business Center 
Mission & Vision 
Mission: Create opportunities for success by connecting businesses to a quality workforce. 
Vision: To effectively connect a world class workforce that meets the needs and exceeds the expectations of our partners in the Adams County business community. 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
During the last year the ACWBC took additional steps to integrate the TANF program into the WBC. Roles were changed and common tasks were assigned to guarantee an enhanced collaboration between the two departments. Processes were changed to make referrals streamlined and readily measurable. 
ACWBC has enhanced the employer engagement and job seeker education through the Opportunity Fair. This event continues to grow and change. ACWBC added services like free haircuts, healthcare opportunities, human service program enrollment, Head Start engagement, and added employers who bend hiring requirements to offer hard-to-serve job seekers an opportunity they would not otherwise have. This unique and innovative event goes against the norm of trying to find the best candidate for each position. It starts with the supply and engages employers who are willing to participate despite the barriers that will inevitably arise with each applicant. 
Arapahoe/Douglas Works! 
Mission & Vision 
Vision: To be a best-in-class workforce development organization responsive to the dynamic needs of job seekers and business/industry. 
Mission: To strategically invest in human capital to contribute to regional economic vitality 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
During PY17, Arapahoe/Douglas Works! invested $8.4 million in public funds to serve 18,448 unique customers. During the program year, 15,533 were placed in employment and were still working six months later at an average annualized wage of $56,385, which was $16,029 above the average annual wage for all new hires in the region. This means that nearly $249 million in additional worker earnings was directly attributable to the value of workforce development services provided by Arapahoe/Douglas Works! 
Of special note are increases in wage outcomes by program: 
. 
WIOA DW wage outcomes increased 5.1% in PY17 to $28.79/hour 

. 
WIOA AD wages increased 4% to $20.50/hour 

. 
Wagner-Peyser wages were up 9.7% to $20.42/hour 

. 
Parents to Work wages increased 4.2% to $14.33/hour 

. 
The biggest gain was 8.9% in TANF/Colorado Works wage outcomes, which rose from $13.32/hour in PY16 to $14.51/hour PY17 


As we continue to collaborate with our partners and programs, it was essential for us to come up with a system that integrated all these aspects to help streamline service delivery. With this, we have worked with the Arapahoe County Information Technology Department to introduce what we call the “Works-System.” This system will essentially combine information for all of our programs in an electronic database, to include WIOA, TANF and EF, for better data recording, electronic case management, and electronic workflow. Furthermore, this will enable our organization to eliminate duplication of services between programs and for better collaboration when providing customers wrap-around services. Moreover, career coaches will be able to access the information and forms they need in one repository to further streamline processes and enhance customer service. It is an iterative database which will continue to be developed and improved as Arapahoe/Douglas Works! staff enter information and recognize needs the system can fulfill. 
Denver Workforce Services 
Mission & Vision 
Vision: Our economic strategy must be boldly ambitious, with innovative, forward-thinking policies that are intent upon delivering a world-class city where everyone matters. The Denver Workforce Development Board will be the sought-after partnership model of business, workforce, community, educational, and civic leaders that empowers all job-seekers to learn and grow so they can contribute to and fulfill the needs of a vibrant business community. 
Mission: OED will be a driving force that advances economic prosperity for the City of Denver, its businesses, neighborhoods, and residents through purposeful and intentional economic development that (1) broadens the tax base; (2) stimulates balanced economic growth through business assistance, neighborhood revitalization, and the development of a skilled workforce; and (3) focuses on innovation, sustainability and education. The Denver WDB convenes key workforce partners including business leaders, education partners, and the Mayor’s economic and workforce development team who plan and oversee the use of federal, state, and local funds to deliver talent development solutions to Denver area businesses so they can generate employment opportunities for all job seekers and provide Denver citizens with a thriving economy. 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
Denver Workforce Services doubled-down on Sector Partnerships in PY17. DWS has dedicated more staff time and resources to the convening of these partnerships than any prior year. DWS believes that an employer-led and informed workforce system allows us to be proactive and meet not only the current needs, but also the future needs of Denver’s key industries, and we believe that Sector Partnerships are the avenue to get us there. In PY17 we were a part of launching and/or convening three new Sector Partnerships in construction, retail, and IT, and have also moved into a convener role in healthcare. All of our Sector Partnerships have experienced different levels of success, from the creation of new apprenticeships, to training provider curriculum adjustments, to WIOA-funded training cohorts. Denver will continue to focus our energy and resources in PY18 with the planned launch of at least one new Sector Partnership. 
Denver Workforce Services joined an alliance of training and resource organizations, branded as CORE (Colorado Resource) Partners, to foster demand driven skills attainment and employment using regional infrastructure projects such as the Central 70 and National Western Center projects as catalysts, with the goal of enabling upward mobility for Metro Denver residents and families, while aligning and integrating programs and services. In order to solve the issues of siloed and reduced funding environments, inconsistent alignment across organizations, inequitable access to services and information, and a shortage of construction workers, DWS and the CORE Partners launched the WORKNOW employment platform in October 2017. The WORKNOW platform allows Denver Metro residents access to a variety of training, placement, and support services through a network of navigators who are located at various CORE Partner locations, and who utilize shared and flexible funding. Since October WORKNOW has enrolled 442 individuals, with more than 200 of those job seekers securing construction industry employment. Eighty-one individuals have already reported a wage increase since their employment start date. 
Employment Services of Weld County 
Mission & Vision: 
To keep the workforce system responsive to employers, employees, and job seekers. 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
ESWC strategically identified WDB and committee members, along with community partners, to attend the TalentFOUND Summit and other related training opportunities. This intentional strategy has strengthened partnerships and supports community wide alignment regarding work-based learning initiatives. 
An accomplishment of which we are proud is the willingness of an employer, two partners from DOC, and WIOA Adult Programs to join Business Services in the planning of the RMWDA workshop. Moreover, the partners have committed time away from their hectic schedules to be on a panel at the workshop! This action alone speaks volumes about the strength of the collaborative effort! 
The Weld WORKS team is an innovative approach to addressing employer concerns in an efficient, impactful method. It values the time and expertise of the employer, as well as each partner agency (workforce, education, and economic development). The Weld Works team meets at least monthly and involves additional partners as appropriate to meet the specific employer’s needs. 
The collaboration with DOC and employers has proven to be extremely favorable. In fact, during PY17, the efforts of the team were selected for a workshop to be held at the Rocky Mountain Workforce Development Association Conference in August 2018. Although the workshop will be presented during PY18, the selection and acknowledgment of the teamwork occurred in PY17. 
The WW4Y program provides work experience opportunities for youth ages 14 and 15 throughout Weld County. The youth had the option of attending life skills workshops in addition to their work experience placements. The program’s goal is to develop employment skills and help families financially during the months of June and July. 
Pillars of Successful Independence (PSI) is a program that works with 13-1/2 to 15-year-old individuals that are placed in foster care or have been placed with kinship in Weld County. Youth served through the PSI program benefit from the four major aspects of the program which include: education, life skills, social skills, and employment. With the involvement of foster parents and family members, it is anticipated the youth will make a smoother transition into the Chafee program, and as a result will have a smoother transition from Chafee into their eventual independence/emancipation from the foster care system. The youth attend workshops two times each month to build portfolios, gain skills, and prepare them for summer employment. Each youth is placed in a summer work experience allowing them to earn money and gain basic work ethic and work skills. They also attend quarterly field trips/socialization activities to learn, enhance, and use skills. The PSI program was initially developed in 2006 by a youth case manager and ran through 2011 when funding became an issue. PSI was able to make a comeback this year and has a goal to serve 15 youth by the end of the year; so far six individuals have been enrolled. 
Jefferson County Business and Workforce Center 
Mission & Vision 
Mission: To promote economic vitality by identifying, developing, and matching a talented workforce to business. 
Vision: Jefferson, Clear Creek and Gilpin businesses utilize the American Job Center as the premier source for qualified talent. 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
The Tri-County Workforce local area increased enrollment percentages of priority of service populations through strategic partnerships and planning. The Career Explore program, our on-site GED tutoring, and partnerships with Community Corrections, Employment First, Jeffco Work Release, Project Search, and STEP are creating new career pathways by developing marketable vocational skills, earning required certifications and gaining relevant work experience leading to employment. 
The Tri-County Workforce local area also increased the number of customers participating in work-based learning activities in all WIOA and other discretionary grant programs. We created new work-based learning programs in all targeted industry sectors and are leaders in developing regional partnerships with Advanced Manufacturing and Information Technology. Additionally, the Career Explore program, in partnership with the school district, DVR and employer/training partners continues to expand and develop occupational skills needed in hospitality, construction and healthcare. In its third year, this work-based learning program has proven to be so successful in re-engaging students at risk of dropping out of high school that Jefferson County Schools created a new program and positions to expand this initiative across the county. 
Our success is driven by our vision which allows our teams to partner, collaborate and serve in a generative manner and make a bigger impact in the community and our customers lives. 
Culinary Career Pathway: We developed a pilot program with Work Options for Women (WOW), Intervention Community Corrections Services (ICCS) and Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO) to provide training opportunities to women coming out of incarceration and currently living at ICCS. The partnership will offer wrap around services that will fully support each participant’s needs while the participant is gaining culinary skills to enable them to enter the food service industry. In addition to learning entry level culinary skills, there will be a guided career path of other opportunities that will offer advanced training at a higher earning potential. The program began its first cohort in May and will pilot for the next year. 
IT Career Pathway: The Tri-County Workforce Development Area identified a need to create an Information Technology (IT) Career Pathway accelerating access to self-sufficiency through industry-focused training, work-based learning, and career coaching. Trico is testing a new concept with the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) to provide IT training to individuals living in high-poverty areas, as well as CW STEP (Subsidized Training and Employment Program), Colorado Works, Jeffco Prosperity Project, WIOA and other Human Services participants. 
Larimer County Workforce Center 
Mission & Vision 
Vision: We are a vital, energetic, recognized leader employing a deep understanding of economic and workforce trends to positively influence the Northern Colorado economy and to create better lives for all who live and work here. 
Mission: Larimer County Economic and Workforce Development connects people to meaningful work and businesses to talent and resources, improving our community’s economic well-being. We care, and our customers matter. 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
We are most proud of the resiliency, perseverance, and commitment to our customers that staff continues to demonstrate during times of concurrent, overlapping, and consistent change. 
Merging the former Workforce Center and Economic Departments into one integrated department is the most important innovation that the Larimer County Economic and Workforce Development Department has participated in during the past year. We are intentionally blending, integrating, and streamlining the purposes of both departments into a fully-functioning, comprehensive department that accepts the challenges associated with shaping the future of Northern Colorado. 
One of the most important innovations that has been developed and implemented this past year is the goal achievement coaching model and the use of technology within the Larimer County Works Program (i.e., TANF). Our work in this area has drawn national attention and has resulted in presentation requests at the National Association of Welfare Research and Statistics conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and at the Forum on Strengthening the Employment and Training Components of WorkfFirst New Jersey at the Heldrich Center, Rutgers University. In December, the Larimer County Workforce Center was invited to present at the Joyce Foundation/Mathematica Convening: Promoting Goal-Oriented Coaching in Workforce Programs in Washington, DC. Workforce development representatives from Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, along with federal agency representatives, were present to learn more about our efforts to integrate evidence informed goal achievement strategies into coaching mandated customers.

Mission: To promote the economic vitality of the Pikes Peak Area by fulfilling its mission to connect vital businesses with work-ready job seekers and employer-driven services. 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
Engaging youth can be challenging, but in six short months with three new initiatives beginning January 2017, the PPWFC increased its work experience outcomes, immersed customers in career exploration, and engaged businesses as mentors and successful employers. Our success highlights how caring for young adults, giving them the confidence to try new things, and supporting them with a Success Coach was the way to increase ROI. From the basics of outreach, to the Bring Your A Game Work Readiness Series training that promotes mentoring from the start, to the implementation of a Success Coach, to the immersion of customers in a one-week career exploration, these efforts have resulted in the achievement of these work experience outcomes: 
. 
Exceeded 20% Youth Work Experience expenditure requirement 

. 
Increased overall program enrollment levels 

. 
Successfully completed a high percentage of program participants 


This program was recently recognized by the Youth Symposium and was presented at the NAJA conference. A short four minute video was created to show the change of WIOA youth confidence, behavior and attitude from day 1 to day 2.5. This video has been shown to community partners, elected officials and board members and is available upon request. 
Workforce Boulder County 
Mission & Vision 
Vision: To promote workforce development through service integration and a flexible response to the changing needs of our clients and customers. 
Mission: To provide comprehensive and effective employment, training and supportive services to Boulder County residents. 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
Workforce Boulder County works to create an understandable and engaging message about our work-based learning service strategy. This program year we hosted an Open House and an Employer Appreciation Breakfast which highlighted this service. 
We conducted specific targeted outreach, and trained staff to become Outreach Ambassadors to spread the message of our role in the community while deepening our existing partnerships and connecting to key service strategies. 
We created several work-based learning videos of which we are very proud. Links to two of those videos are below: 
Work Based Learning -Video #1 Work Based Learning -Video #2 
The implementation of operator procurement, Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), and Infrastructure Agreements was completed ahead of deadline. 
The NEG was successful, all enrollment goals were met and the grant has been successfully closed out with all monies spent. 
Job Seeker Services Alignment (JSSA) is progressing. JSSA is the aligning of workforce with mandatory partners including DVR, Adult Ed, and TANF. 
Our success lies in the success of our clients. See below for three of the many successes that highlight our work. 
Shelley is a TANF participant whose internship at Boulder County Finance was extended through CW STEP so she could continue her training, get additional work experience and build references. Not too long before being placed in an internship, Shelly had gotten a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and already had relevant experience in office management and payroll. Shelley’s goal was to get experience in accounting and finance so she could find employment in the field. Shelley was placed as a part time (24 hours per week) Accounting Clerk intern and she had an outstanding performance during the initial phase of her internship. For this reason, and for the demand of talent that the SWIFT project brought to Boulder County Finance, Shelley’s supervisor requested WfBC to extend Shelley’s internship for two additional months and to increase her working hours to 40 per week. The extension was approved and Shelley was enrolled in CW STEP. While still on her internship, Shelley applied for an Accountant I position. When Shelley completed her internship, she was offered the position she applied for. She is now a Boulder County employee and her hourly wage is $24.17. 
Assadullah H. is an architect with relevant work experience is his country of origin, Afghanistan. He moved to the U.S. with his family less than a year ago, and enrolled in the 
TANF program to get the resources he needed to get settled. Assadullah and his wife are taking ESL classes with Intercambio to improve their English skills (she is already in Level 3 and he is on Level 6). Assadullah was referred to WfBC Business Services team by his TANF Case Manager without having him previously taken any job readiness workshop. When a Business Services representative met with Assadullah, she saw a bright and super motivated human being who saw an internship as an opportunity to get back to the career he chose and is passionate about. However, Assadullah needed to be prepared, and referring him to workshops was not the best way to serve him at that time since communication was a barrier for him, especially when he had to talk about his technical skills. 
Business Services referred Assadullah to the WfBC Community Learning & Empowerment (CL&E) team for individual job readiness assistance. Assadullah met at least five times with a CL&E Specialist to work on his resume and get ready for an interview. During this journey, and while he was waiting for a site to be developed, Assadullah decided to start interviewing with different grocery stores and retail employers as a way of practicing. He suffered discrimination and felt rejected several times; once he was even told to “come back when your English gets better.” These negative experiences discouraged Assadullah and pulled his confidence and self-esteem down. 
However, the Business Services team was actively seeking an employer that would offer Assadullah the opportunity he was looking for -and we found it! While doing an Employment Verification, a Business Services representative connected with F&D International (FDI), a small firm in Boulder that offers Architecture, Project Management, and Engineering Services, that was looking for an Auto Cad Draftsman. Assadullah was referred to this employer, who understood Assadullah’s situation and decided to interview him after reviewing his “impressive” resume. Assadullah had a final 1:1 interview practice session, and though he was nervous he decided to take this opportunity. The interview went well and Assadullah was offered a 12-week internship opportunity (so he could demonstrate his technical competencies.) The employer has already communicated his intention to hire Assadullah once his internship is completed. He will be offered a FT position that pays between $25 and $35 per hour. 
Debbie S. was the first TANF eligible participant who responded to our Craigslist ad. After more than 20 years of work at a private IT company, Debbie was laid off from her Project Manager position. She was about to exhaust her unemployment benefits when she saw our “WBL ad.” The WBL unit connected with her and helped her update her resume. Since she was ready to interview she was referred to Boulder County IT for an internship opportunity to work as one of the project coordinators for the Swift Project. Debbie showed how talented she is and after only six weeks of her internship, she was offered the Swift Project Program Administration position by Boulder County IT, and she is making $45 per hour now. 
WfBC has developed an innovative approach to assisting job seekers utilizing a Road Map/Individual Employment Plan. This Career Coaching service offers WfBC job seekers access to one-on-one coaching to further their employment goals. Specifically designed for those individuals who are not likely to utilize funding to move along their career path, the Road Map offers intensive case management and respective programming supported by individualized Career Coaching. 
Job seekers who are repeat customers, are highly motivated but not ready for work-based learning or occupational skills training, and are not entirely sure of what career pathway they are interested in pursuing are the job seekers most likely to benefit from this service. 
The Career Coaching service utilizes a S.M.A.R.T Goal format and supports one-on-one career coaching at a minimum of one time per month, targeted goal setting (S.M.A.R.T Goal), an accountability partner, designated career services including resume and interview assistance, networking support, job search support, access to YouScience (an in-depth assessment tool), and access to the Talent Pool. The goal of the Road Map is to assist WfBC customers in reaching their goals by supporting job seekers in obtaining permanent employment aligned with their chosen career pathway. 
WfBC is participating in the Central Planning Region’s Workforce Intelligence Workgroup. The stated mission of the group is to provide access to resources and data analysis that supports business service activities and economic development under WIOA. The group offers a link to data experts dedicated to providing additional data analytics to BSRs, Business Partners, and the community at large in supporting economic development. The group also is active in developing an annual regional economic impact report as well as a regional annual business services report. In addition to the reports, the Workforce Intelligence Workgroup is working to standardize labor market information and align NAICS codes by industry for the region, with the goal of offering consistency in local and regional labor market information provided to business services, partners, and businesses. 
The WfBC Work-Based Learning Unit also stands out as an innovative approach to improvement and systems integration of work-based learning strategies and services. The team is developing key recommendations for PY18 that will be presented to leadership and integrated into our goals for the next program year. 
Colorado Rural Workforce Consortium 
Mission & Vision 
Vision: Every Colorado business has access to a skilled workforce and every Coloradan has access to meaningful employment, resulting in statewide economic vitality. 
Mission: To foster business-focused workforce partnerships, effectively preparing rural Coloradans for the jobs of today and tomorrow. 
The Colorado Rural Workforce Consortium (CRWC) is a consortium of 10 sub-areas comprised of 51 counties. The sub-areas include: Broomfield, Eastern, Pueblo, Rural Resort, Northwest, South Central, Southeast, Southwest, Upper Arkansas, and Western. Broomfield is county-run, while the remaining sub-areas are state-run. Four of the nine state-run sub-areas have contractors that deliver Title I-B services. Outstanding outcomes from nine of the sub-areas are highlighted below. 
Eastern-Sub Area 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
The TRAINcation events would be Eastern’s primary highlight. This initiative involved multiple partners, over 20 employers, and three workforce offices, one of which is a single staff location.

Eastern re-organized to meet the needs of the WIOA Career Coaches by re-allocating an existing Labor and Employment Specialist II. This position is designed to provide more internal support to the Eastern case management team, and fulfill the internal monitoring expectations. In addition, the office in which this position is located recently moved, and now has room to have a dedicated staff training room as needed. 
Externally, an overall expansion in partnerships with Human Services, which includes online daily job postings in Logan County, reformatted outreach to Phillips County DHS, dedicated day per week on site in Yuma County, and site co-location in Elbert County. In addition, contracts are being developed for the Burlington Workforce Center to absorb the Employment First program for both Cheyenne and Kit Carson counties. We expect this to fully finalized before their federal fiscal year start on October 1st. 
Pueblo Sub-Area 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
The Colorado Mental Health Institution (CMHIP) located in Pueblo has been experiencing severe staffing shortages. This has put their accreditation at risk, been highlighted in the media, and caused them to close the Circle program, which is a residential mental illness and substance abuse treatment program. This program was funded by the General Assembly last year so the temporary closure is a concern with lawmakers as well. Among other positions, CMHIP is in dire need of Psychiatric Technicians. Pueblo Community College (PCC) is the only college in the state that offers a Psychiatric Technician program. Due to low enrollment, the college was considering closing the program. 
The Pueblo Workforce Center (PWFC) met with PCC and CMHIP to identify the cause of the low enrollment problem. It was identified that PCC required students to complete two prerequisite courses that were non-credit bearing and cost $1,300, therefore not eligible for PELL or WIOA funded tuition assistance. The PWFC asked PCC to modify their program to include these courses in their certificate program so students would be eligible for PELL and WIOA tuition assistance through the PWFC, which they agreed to do. 
The PWFC utilized the RESEA program and a list of individuals that had been part of a large lay-off to conduct outreach. On August 21st, 15 students began college in the Psychiatric Technician program. In addition to having PELL available to them, they were sponsored using funds from the WIOA NEG Sector Grant. CMHIP championed this effort by guaranteeing that each student will be employed part-time while in college at a minimum of $11.50 per hour. Once they graduate and receive their license, they will be earning over $17.00 an hour. This on average is $5.00 per hour more than they were being paid from their jobs of dislocation. With the eight WIOA sponsored students who have graduated from the program, CMHIP reported a total of 22 new Psych Techs who graduated and are now working at CMHIP. 
Rural Resort/Northwest Sub-Area 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
In 2017, a collaborative partnership was enhanced between Colorado Mountain College, GED Program and the Rifle/Glenwood Springs Workforce Centers. 
Thirty-three Title I youth participants graduated with their General Education Diploma in PY17 in Garfield County. Most also successfully participated in a work-based learning opportunity. This combining of resources more than doubled the total number of program completers at the Rifle campus over the previous year. 
Staff from the two agencies have become a seamless team – supporting, motivating, coaching and mentoring their shared clientele as one -with outstanding success. Post program data captured in performance outcome reporting for PY17 demonstrated credential attainment and employment/post-secondary placement of participating youth at 100%. 
South Central Sub-Area 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
Over the last year the progress that has been made and is being made within the Healthcare Sector in the San Luis Valley has been measurable. The use of the Virtual Job Shadowing tool for career pathways exploration has been an integral piece to assist in the Healthcare Sector “grow your own” pipeline. It has been a worthwhile endeavor due to the amount of interest that there has been throughout the valley school districts. In addition, the jobs database has been worked on and is nearing completion, along with a soon to be completed website that will facilitate easier access to “healthcare as a career” and other information within the San Luis Valley. For the first time, the Region 8 Healthcare Sector awarded three scholarships; the scholarships were designed to assist San Luis Valley resident healthcare students at Adams State University or Trinidad State Junior College. Each scholarship provided support in the amount of $2,000 for each recipient. The partnership hopes to continue their momentum and be able to further their mission and vision over the next year. 
Implementing the Virtual Job Shadowing tool in every school district for career pathways to assist in the Healthcare Sector has been very appreciated in the San Luis Valley. Staff in the South Central Sub Area presented the Virtual Job Shadow tool at a Healthcare Sector Meeting during the last year; because of this presentation many employers, community partners, and school district officials saw the benefit of the tool. We are pleased to share that all school districts within the San Luis Valley are on-board in the utilization of this tool. The feedback that we have been given is that the tool has allowed a more assertive focus on developing a healthcare career pipeline, and opened up opportunities that students were unaware of in other career fields. The Virtual Job Shadow tool has been utilized in medical/health classes to identify career possibilities and the pathways needed to reach those goals. Because of these efforts the Workforce Center has seen an increase in partnerships as well as engagement. 
Southeast Sub-Area 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
The Southeast Sub Area was a sponsor for the 2nd Annual Youth Entrepreneurship Fair that was held at Otero Junior College on Wednesday May 9, 2018. Students in grades 5-12 from Baca, Bent, Crowley, Kiowa, Otero and Prowers counties were invited to take part in this fair. The intent of the fair was to get youth in these areas to think “entrepreneurially.” Students were challenged to think of a business they could start, a business they could buy, a service they could provide, or a widget they could manufacture. Because of these ventures, after high school graduation they could either stay or return to the Arkansas Valley or anywhere in Southeast Colorado to live and work and raise their families while bringing their ideas to life. Youth out-migration is a major problem in many small, rural towns; the Entrepreneurship Fair is viewed as a way to begin to stem that migration of rural youth. The day began with a display of student projects. There were nine middle school projects and thirteen high school projects, and a total of 30 youth that took part. Each student participating was required to complete a one-page business plan, develop a table top exhibit, and be prepared to visit with a judging panel about his/her business. Following the judges’ review of the projects, there were six projects selected in the middle school division and six in the high school division that moved on to the next round. The students exhibiting those projects then had five minutes to “pitch” their business idea to an Investor Panel of judges in the hope of winning cash prizes for their business endeavor. It was a “Shark Tank” experience for these young business-minded students. The feedback given from this fair was positive, not only from the students but also from the judges that took part. 
In April 2018, Betty Velasquez, Southeast & South Central Sub Area Director, Olga Ruiz, State Monitor Advocate, and Elva Macias, Labor & Employment Specialist, were asked to present at the National MAFO Conference. These staff presented on “Building Employer and Stakeholder Partnerships, Beyond the Placement,” and shared experiences in developing relationships with employer customers. There were nearly 50 conference goers in attendance for this presentation. The presentation consisted of focusing on developing a role of trusted partnerships with the employer customer that expands services from those taking job leads, making placements, and monitoring for compliance, to convening and brokering partner services, to developing customized responses with employers to address changes in technology transfers, contractions and expansions. Several people from Colorado also spoke briefly on their services to employers. Sherman Swafford, Regional Services Unit Manager sent an email to Betty stating, “I attended your group’s presentation and it was excellent! I think it was one of, if not the best presentation during the MAFO Conference.” 
One of the highlights for the Healthcare Sector Partnership this year was the participation of 15+ local youth who each received assistance through one of the Healthcare Sector’s grant-funded committee projects called ‘No Stumbling Blocks.’ ‘No Stumbling Blocks’ assists students who are taking a healthcare course at the local junior college while attending high school. Students were assisted with $250 towards training-related expenses that are not covered by their high school’s assistance with tuition. Students utilized these grant funds to cover expenses related to taking the Nursing Assistant and Emergency Medical Technician course. As part of the requirement of this scholarship, students attended the meeting to talk to the full board about how the ‘No Stumbling Blocks’ grant funds assisted them in achieving their training goals and how it related to their long term education and employment goals in a healthcare career pathway. All students in attendance agreed that being able to complete this goal solidified their interest in the healthcare field, and expressed gratitude to the board for awarding them this opportunity. 
Southwest Sub-Area 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
Many of the students who attended the job readiness class at Southwest Open High were able to obtain employment by putting into practice the things they learned in class. Taking the “My Next Move” assessment and navigating through LMI helped them target employment that was a fit for them. Their resumes were polished and ready to submit to employers. Other students were able to pin down their occupational and/or educational goals. Students took the extra effort to come by the workforce center to thank their teacher. 
The Cortez workforce staff person went into the classroom at Southwest Open High School for one-and-a-half hours three times/week and taught the A Game, Conover, Prove It and job readiness classes for 12 weeks. In this class, students: 
. 
Obtained the Conover certificate

Upper Arkansas Sub-Area 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
The Upper Arkansas team taught employment workshops to 50 inmates at two level five maximum security facilities at the Centennial Correctional Facility in Cañon City, Colorado (Centennial and Colorado State Prison). This is the first time that the Colorado Department of Corrections has allowed outside agencies to deliver workshops to their level five high-risk offenders. These workshops at the level five maximum security facilities are the successful result of several years of negotiating with the Colorado Department of Corrections to allow Colorado Department of Labor and Employment personnel to deliver employment workshops to soon-to-be-released, level five offenders. These workshops are designed to help soon-to-be-released inmates be better prepared for the world of work when they are discharged from prison. 
Western Sub-Area 
Accomplishments and Innovation in PY17: 
The Western sub-area, as well as the rest of the CRWC, has seen a major swing in the demand and supply of workers. As a result, employers have become the main Workforce Center customer. Workforce Center staff continue to change their focus to meet the needs of employers and to assist employers in recruiting and retaining workers. The Western sub-area has utilized social media, including Facebook, to help promote employment opportunities and hiring events. Additionally, the area has partnered with Skillful to promote skill-based hiring and with Mesa County to promote Work Ready Communities.
